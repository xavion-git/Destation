# 🗺️Destination Tracker
> By:Xavion Dean
A simple and helpful trip-planning tool built to organize destinations, travel routes, food spots, and activities for an upcoming adventure in Japan.
## What Is This?
Destination Tracker is a lightweight application created to help plan and navigate a trip to Japan.
It allows you to keep track of:
- 📍 Places you want to visit
- 🚆 How to get there (transportation routes)
- 🍜 Nearby food spots
- 🎎 Local activities and things to do

## 🎯 Why I’m Making This
I’m traveling to Japan with a friend group, and I was assigned the role of figuring out how we’ll:
- Navigate between destinations
- Know what’s nearby (food, activities, attractions)
- Stay organized during the trip
Instead of juggling notes, maps, and random websites, I decided to build a small app to centralize everything.
As a developer, creating a custom tool just made sense—cleaner, faster, and actually fun to use.

## 💡 Goal of the Project
- Make planning simpler
- Provide quick access to travel routes
- Store useful locations
- Keep food + activities organized
- Help the group travel stress-free

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
